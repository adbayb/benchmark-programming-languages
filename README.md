    <h1>🚀 Language benchmarks</h1>
    <strong>Runtime performance benchmarks of different languages</strong>
</div>
<br>
<br>

## 💪 Motivation

This repository aims to compare runtime performance of different languages (C, Go, JavaScript, Rust and Zig) over time through several cases such as bubble sort algorithm, file IO, loop...
To be fair enough, the implementations try to be as close/similar as possible between languages.

Contributions are welcomed ✌️.

## 🚀 Quickstart

To run the benchmark cases **locally**, Docker can be used to simplify the execution flow:

Build the image:

```bash
TODO
```

Run the image:

```bash
TODO
```

## 🔢 Results

TODO docker (fix compiler version) + github action
